# BioNeuron: TensorFlow-based Biological Activation Functions


This project presents a novel technique for implementing a biological neuron activation function on TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The technique is inspired by the biophysical properties and dynamics of biological neurons, and aims to improve the performance and robustness of artificial neural networks. The technique can be applied to various neural network architectures and tasks, such as classification, regression, and generative modeling.
